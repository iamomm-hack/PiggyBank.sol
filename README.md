# 🏦 EtherVault: A Time-Locked Piggy Bank Smart Contract

**EtherVault** is a beginner-friendly Ethereum smart contract that allows users to save their Ether securely and withdraw it **only after a specified lock period**. Built with Solidity, it's ideal for learning smart contract basics, time-based logic, and safe fund management.

---

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 🔐 **Time-locked Savings** — Withdraw funds only after a fixed duration.
- 👤 **Owner-only Withdrawals** — Ensures only the contract owner can access the funds.
- 💰 **Ether Deposit & Balance Tracking** — Easily send and track stored Ether.
- ⚙️ **Beginner Friendly** — Great for students and devs new to Solidity and blockchain development.

## 📌 Why EtherVault?

Time-locked wallets are a fundamental concept in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain security. This contract demonstrates:
- How smart contracts manage time using `block.timestamp`
- How to handle Ether deposits and secure withdrawals
- Access control via `msg.sender`
- Real-world use cases like crypto saving vaults, token vesting, and staking lock-ins
